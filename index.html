          In BranchOut, we strive to team up with fellow Canadians as well as
          many other people all around the world to fight against pollution as
          one. Littering in beaches and forests lead to countless animal lives
          lost. Eventually, it even destroys the very soil we walk on. As an
          organization, we truly believe that if we take the time to Branch out
          to others and Connect with them, we can work towards Restoring the
          dying beauty of nature. We need all the help we can get.

              Sickness has been normalized in our society. Many people who have
              problems like chronic fatigue, insomnia, acid reflux, joint pain,
              allergies, extra belly fat, depression, or digestive issues
              consider it normal because they know that these are common
              problems. Just because a problem is common, does not make it
              normal. The bigger issue is that many people don't consider these
              problems to be modifiable, they think it is all due to genetics.
              For instance, you may have trouble focusing for extended periods
              of time due to dopamine deficiency. The deficiency could be caused
              by excess alcohol consumption, caffeine use, sleep deprivation,
              overuse of social media, or a whole host of other possibilities.
              Many people do not even think to seek out nutrition or lifestyle
              changes for a problem like poor focus. Deep Wellness uses a
              broader definition of health than most. We think the idea of
              health should include physical health, mental health, emotional
              health, spiritual health, and how all of these parts of a person
              interact with the people and environment around them.

              It is a misnomer that being healthy means sacrifice or
              deprivation. Wellness is a process. It doesn't do you any good to
              give up all of the "unhealthy" things that you do all at once if
              you feel deprived, because you will eventually revert back to your
              old habits. Being healthy is about making positive changes. It
              doesn't matter how small the changes are, as long as they are
              lasting changes. As you move deeper into your personal wellness
              journey, you will also find that many of the beliefs that you held
              about what is "healthy" were not quite right. Your tastes may
              change. Your aversions may dissipate. Your awareness of subtle
              pleasures may intensify. You may find that you, dare I say it...
              LIKE the things that make you healthier.

              One of the biggest misconceptions around positive change is that
              you will eventually reach a point where everything aligns. You
              decide to eat better, you exercise more, you have time for your
              loved ones, you no longer want the harmful things that you
              currently crave. This is a utopian vision that many people have,
              but it will never happen. The reality is that change happens in a
              subtle way. Instead of sweeping life changes, you get one habit
              change. Instead of storybook weight loss, you lose 8 lbs. Instead
              of curing your ailment, you discover something that helps you and
              that you can explore deeper. True wellness usually involves
              incremental change. If you are waiting for the right time to
              start, you may have already missed the boat.

              All of the programs that are currently available or in development
              will be online. You will receive physical materials by mail,
              digital materials, access to program specific materials on the
              website, access to members only forums, and anything else that
              each specific program includes. You can reach out at any time to
              the Deep Wellness team or other members in the forums or by email
              for encouragement, help, or clarification. Some programs may also
              include periodic check-ins with the Deep Wellness team and live
              webinars during the program.

              If you think that you can't lose those last pounds because you
              don't have the time to work out or the willpower to diet, I've got
              good news for you. You don't need that time or that willpower.
              Some things can be accomplished through brute force, but that's
              not the only way and certainly not the best way. A more effective
              approach is to target points of limitation. Our programs teach you
              to find out why you have trouble sticking to a regimen, what
              habits are keeping you from achieving your goals, and how you can
              make small adjustments that make a big difference. Even if weight
              loss is your only focus, we will show you the seemingly unrelated
              areas that integrate with weight management that most people miss.

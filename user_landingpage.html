        In BranchOut, we strive to team up with fellow Canadians as well as
        many other people all around the world to fight against pollution as
        one. Littering in beaches and forests leads to countless animal lives
        lost. Eventually, it even destroys the very soil we walk on. As an
        organization, we truly believe that if we take the time to Branch out
        to others and Connect with them, we can work towards Restoring the
        dying beauty of nature. We need all the help we can get.
